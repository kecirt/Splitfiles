# Splitfiles
An easy-to-use set of python scripts that split csv or xlsx spreadsheets into separate files based on different field values.

# What to know
This repo is tailored towards a limited sample of existing Internet Service Providers (ISP) located in the Republic of Kenya and includes scripts to draft emails in a specified mailbox for preparation of dispatch.

# How to use
Assuming you are conversant with python, install the dependancies from requirements.txt, edit the necessary configurations to fit your needs in the associated scripts and run the command as follows:

<code> python3 splitfiles.py /path/to/file/to/split.csv </code>

# Workflow and management
These scripts incorporate retired cyber incident management workflows that were used to automate the sorting and drafting cyber event advisories sourced from various providers. You should therefore enhance your existing manual workflow with most if not all of the scripts provided.

# Split script for any given field in any spreadsheet

<code> python3 count_event_by_rows.py /path/to/file/to/split.csv </code>
